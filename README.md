This is a prototype created in SageMath and Python that colors a given graph

You can run the code in Jupyter notebook if you have a local installation of SageMath in your system. Refer to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html for
information on the installation process

Else you can run the codes in online Sage Cell Server by accessing the link, https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
